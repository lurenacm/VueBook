Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 90–95 % of all diagnosed cases. Type 2 diabetes usually results from insulin resistance, a disorder in which the body does not properly use insulin, as well as problems with insulin production [<cite><a href="#CR00073">3</a></cite>]. Diabetes is associated with numerous serious health complications such as cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, nervous system damage, and amputations [<cite><a href="#CR00072">2</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00073">3</a></cite>]. African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans are at higher risk for Type 2 diabetes than are non-Hispanic whites [<cite><a href="#CR00072">2</a></cite>]. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, a history of gestational diabetes, and a family history of diabetes [<cite><a href="#CR00072">2</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00073">3</a></cite>].<div class="Figure" id="Fig0007a"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO00071"><img src="A311816_1_En_7_Figa_HTML.gif" alt="A311816_1_En_7_Figa_HTML.gif"/></div></div>

About 32.8 % of all deaths in the USA (811,940) were attributable to CVD in 2008 [<cite><a href="#CR00077">7</a></cite>].

Although non-Hispanic whites had higher current asthma prevalence estimates than Hispanics among those aged 30 and older, this difference was only statistically significant for those aged 45–64 (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig000711">7.11</a></span>).
