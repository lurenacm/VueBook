More than 1.6 million Americans are expected to be diagnosed with cancer and more than 577,000 Americans are expected to die from cancer-related causes in 2012 [<cite><a href="#CR00051">1</a></cite>]. In Texas, more than 110,000 residents are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and more than 39,000 cancer-related deaths are expected [<cite><a href="#CR00052">2</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">Cancer begins when certain cells in the body change and start to grow abnormally and uncontrollably. Cancer cells can also invade other organs and tissues and be spread by the bloodstream and lymphatic system in a process called metastasis. This uncontrolled growth and spread of cancer can result in serious health problems and death. Currently, doctors cannot determine what causes cancer in an individual person, but there are several risk factors that may play a role in cancer development including aging, tobacco, alcohol consumption, sunlight, ionizing radiation, certain viruses and bacteria, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, being overweight, certain hormones, and certain chemicals [<cite><a href="#CR00053">3</a></cite>]. Many of these risk factors can be avoided, thus lowering a person’s risk of developing cancer. Other risk factors cannot be avoided, but many cancers can be cured if detected and treated early. Incidence and mortality rates for each cancer are presented as age-adjusted rates or age-specific rates.</div><div id="Sec00051" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Breast Cancer</h2><div class="Para">Breast cancer usually develops in cells that line the ducts that carry milk to the nipples (ductal cancer) or in cells of the glands, which make milk (lobular cancer). Ductal cancer is more common than lobular cancer. Although more rare, cancer can also occur in other tissues of the breast [<cite><a href="#CR00054">4</a></cite>]. Breast cancer is the most common diagnosis of cancer in Texas and US women [<cite><a href="#CR00051">1</a></cite>]. It is estimated that in 2012, approximately 16,127 Texas women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 2,867 women will die of the disease [<cite><a href="#CR00052">2</a></cite>]. Breast cancer occurs most frequently in women, but men can also develop breast cancer. Hispanic women have a lower risk of developing breast cancer than non-Hispanic women, who are at greater risk than African-American women [<cite><a href="#CR00055">5</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">Increasing age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer [<cite><a href="#CR00051">1</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00056">6</a></cite>]. Other risk factors include a personal or family history of breast cancer, genetic mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, certain breast changes such as atypical hyperplasia, high breast tissue density, high dose radiation to the chest, and certain reproductive factors such as never having children, having a first child after age 30, or having menstrual periods start early or end late in life. Modifiable risk factors for breast cancer include lack of physical activity, alcohol use, being overweight after menopause, and oral contraceptive use [<cite><a href="#CR00051">1</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00057">7</a></cite>]. Screening tests for breast cancer include the breast self-exam, clinical breast exam, and screening mammography [<cite><a href="#CR00057">7</a></cite>].</div><div class="Figure" id="Fig0005a"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO00051"><img src="A311816_1_En_5_Figa_HTML.gif" alt="A311816_1_En_5_Figa_HTML.gif"/></div></div><div id="Sec00052" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Breast Cancer in South Texas</h3><div class="Para">Overall, women in South Texas had a lower average annual age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer (106.3 cases per 100,000 women) than women in the rest of Texas (117.5/100,000) or nation (124.0/100,000). However, Hispanic women in South Texas had a higher incidence of breast cancer (95.6/100,000) than Hispanics in the rest of Texas (90.7/100,000), although they did not have a statistically significantly higher breast cancer incidence compared to Hispanic women nationwide (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00051">5.1</a></span>).

There are two main types of cervical cancer. By far, the most common type is squamous cell carcinoma, which develops from the cells that line the outer surface of the cervix near the top of the vagina. The other type is adenocarcinoma, which develops from the glandular cells that line the cervix [<cite><a href="#CR00058">8</a></cite>]. There are usually no symptoms of precancerous changes to the cervix. Therefore, regular screening tests such as Pap tests, which can detect abnormal cervical cells before cancer develops, are of great importance [<cite><a href="#CR00058">8</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00059">9</a></cite>].

          </div><div class="Para">Even though cervical cancer is one of the most detectable and preventable cancers through regular screening, it remains a serious threat to the lives of Texas women. In 2012, an estimated 1,255 Texas women will be diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer and 392 women will die of the disease [<cite><a href="#CR000510">10</a></cite>].

Women with HIV or other conditions that result in a weakened immune system are also at higher risk of cervical cancer.

The overall incidence of cervical cancer in both South Texas and rest of Texas were higher than the nationwide incidence (8.1/100,000).

Most of the remaining cases of childhood leukemia will be acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). There are no recommended screening tests for leukemia in asymptomatic children or adolescents [<cite><a href="#CR000530">30</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">Cancer in children and adolescents is relatively rare. Over 10 years (2000–2009), there were 2,859 cases of leukemia, myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disease in Texas children aged 0–14, and an additional 548 cases in adolescents aged 15–19 [<cite><a href="#CR000531">31</a></cite>]. Hispanic children and adolescents are at slightly higher risk of developing leukemia, myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disease compared to non-Hispanic white children and adolescents, while African-American children and adolescents have the lowest risk [<cite><a href="#CR00055">5</a></cite>].In general, rates of leukemia, myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disease are slightly higher in boys than girls [<cite><a href="#CR00055">5</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000530">30</a></cite>]. Little is known about the risk factors for childhood and adolescent leukemia. The few known risk factors include radiation exposure and certain genetic conditions such as Down’s syndrome and Li–Fraumeni syndrome [<cite><a href="#CR000530">30</a></cite>].</div><div id="Sec000518" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Childhood and Adolescent Leukemia in South Texas</h3><div class="Para">Overall, the incidence of childhood and adolescent leukemia in South Texas from 2000 to 2009 (53.5 cases per million children or adolescents) was higher than the incidence in the rest of Texas (46.0/million) or nation (44.9/million). However, Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in South Texas had fairly similar incidences of childhood and adolescent leukemia compared to their counterparts in the rest of Texas and nationwide (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig000525">5.25</a></span>). As also observed in the rest of Texas and nationwide, the incidence of childhood and adolescent leukemia in South Texas was statistically significantly higher for Hispanics (58.1/million) than for non-Hispanic whites (40.7/million) (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig000525">5.25</a></span>).

            </div><div class="Para">As observed nationwide, incidence of childhood and adolescent leukemia in South Texas was higher for males (62.8/million) than females (43.7/million). The overall child and adolescent leukemia mortality rate in South Texas was 12.8/million. The trend in age-specific child and adolescent leukemia was quite different than the trend in incidence; the highest mortality rate was seen among the adolescent (15–19) age group (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig000527">5.27</a></span>). This is also true statewide and nationally; leukemia subtypes differ with age at diagnosis, resulting in less favorable survival rates for infants less than 1 year, followed by adolescents aged 15–19 [<cite><a href="#CR000533">33</a></cite>].
