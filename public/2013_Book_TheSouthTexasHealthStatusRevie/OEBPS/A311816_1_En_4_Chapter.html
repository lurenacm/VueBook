Although most people infected with <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">M. tuberculosis</span> harbor the bacterium with no symptoms (latent TB), some people do eventually develop active TB disease. TB is spread from person to person through the air. Only people with active TB disease can spread the bacteria to others [<cite><a href="#CR00042">2</a></cite>]. TB usually affects the lungs, although it sometimes can also affect other parts of the body such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine.

A TB infection can develop into active TB disease as a result of conditions or exposures that can reduce a person’s immunity such as HIV infection, diabetes, or chemotherapy treatment.

These white blood cells are essential to maintaining an effective immune response. HIV gradually destroys the body’s ability to fight infections and certain cancers by damaging or killing immune system cells [<cite><a href="#CR00047">7</a></cite>]. People with HIV have what is called HIV infection. Some of these people will develop AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) as a result of their HIV infection [<cite><a href="#CR00047">7</a></cite>]. HIV is most commonly transmitted by having unprotected sex with a partner who is infected. HIV can also be spread through contact with infected blood such as sharing drug needles or syringes or through contaminated blood transfusions. Women infected with HIV can transmit the virus to their babies during pregnancy or birth or through breast milk [<cite><a href="#CR00048">8</a></cite>].</div><div class="Figure" id="Fig0004b"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO00102"><img src="A311816_1_En_4_Figb_HTML.gif" alt="A311816_1_En_4_Figb_HTML.gif"/></div></div><div class="Para">Many people do not have any symptoms when they first become infected with HIV. This “asymptomatic” infection period can differ greatly among individuals. Some people may begin to experience symptoms within just a few months, while others may remain symptom free for more than 10 years [<cite><a href="#CR00048">8</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00049">9</a></cite>]. AIDS refers to the most advanced stages of HIV infection [<cite><a href="#CR00048">8</a></cite>]. People with AIDS often contract opportunistic infections that do not usually affect healthy people. In AIDS patients, these infections are frequently severe and are sometimes fatal, because the immune system has been so damaged by HIV that it can no longer resist bacteria, viruses, parasites, or other microbes [<cite><a href="#CR00049">9</a></cite>]. People with AIDS are also particularly susceptible to certain cancers [<cite><a href="#CR000410">10</a></cite>]. No cure exists for HIV or AIDS. However, a number of drugs currently exist that can slow the progression of HIV infection as well as fight associated cancers and infections [<cite><a href="#CR00049">9</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000410">10</a></cite>].
</div><div class="Para">In 2008, approximately 1.2 million individuals in the USA were estimated to be living with either HIV or AIDS, of which an estimated 20 % were undiagnosed and unaware that they had HIV [<cite><a href="#CR000411">11</a></cite>]. There were an estimated 17,774 AIDS deaths in the USA in 2009. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the USA continues to disproportionately affect minority groups. The rate of new HIV infection in 2010 was more than eight times higher in African-Americans and almost three times higher in Hispanics than in non-Hispanic whites [<cite><a href="#CR000412">12</a></cite>]. In 2009, 77 % of newly diagnosed HIV cases in the USA were male [<cite><a href="#CR000411">11</a></cite>]. Major risk factors for HIV/AIDS include having unprotected sex with multiple partners or with men who have sex with men, sharing needles during drug use, or already having hepatitis, tuberculosis (TB), or another sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as syphilis, herpes, or chlamydia [<cite><a href="#CR00047">7</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000410">10</a></cite>].</div><div id="Sec00044" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">HIV/AIDS in South Texas</h3><div class="Para">In 2006–2010, the average annual incidence of HIV/AIDS in South Texas was 11.3/100,000, a lower rate than the incidence in the rest of Texas (18.1/100,000).

Syphilis has been called “the great imitator” because many possible symptoms are associated with the disease, and these symptoms often mirror ones seen in many other diseases [<cite><a href="#CR000413">13</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000414">14</a></cite>]. Syphilis is most commonly spread by sexual contact with an infected individual [<cite><a href="#CR000413">13</a></cite>]. The syphilis bacterium is transmitted by direct contact with a syphilis sore; sores usually occur on the genitals or anus but can also occur on the lips or in the mouth. Syphilis <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">can also be transmitted from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy</span> [<cite><a href="#CR000414">14</a></cite>]. The primary stage of syphilis is characterized by one or more small, round sores, called chancres, that are located where the bacterium entered the body. Because chancres are usually not painful, can occur inside the body, and heal without treatment, symptoms of primary syphilis may go unnoticed. If left untreated, the syphilis infection progresses to the secondary stage, which is usually marked by a skin rash. Symptoms of secondary syphilis may be mild and will also go away without treatment. However, without treatment, syphilis infection is still present in the body. Although there may be no outward signs or symptoms for many years after secondary syphilis, untreated syphilis infection may damage internal organs such as the heart, brain, nervous system, eyes, bones, and joints. Late-stage syphilis infection, which occurs in about 15 % of untreated individuals, can cause blindness, deafness, mental illness, paralysis, heart disease, and even death [<cite><a href="#CR000413">13</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000414">14</a></cite>]. Untreated syphilis in pregnant women is associated with a high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, and infant mortality [<cite><a href="#CR000414">14</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000415">15</a></cite>]. Syphilis is curable with antibiotics, but treatment cannot repair damage already done to the body by syphilis infection [<cite><a href="#CR000414">14</a></cite>].

This bacterium grows easily in many parts of the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes in women, and the urinary tract in both women and men [<cite><a href="#CR000416">16</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000420">20</a></cite>]. Gonorrhea can also grow in the throat, mouth, eyes, and anus. Gonorrhea bacteria <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">can be transmitted by contact with the penis, mouth, vagina, or anus of an infected individual; ejaculation is not necessary for the disease to be spread. Gonorrhea can also be transmitted from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth</span> [<cite><a href="#CR000420">20</a></cite>]. If left untreated, gonorrhea can cause permanent health problems in both sexes, and can cause a painful testicular condition called epididymitis in men.

There were 309,341 reported cases of gonorrhea in the USA in 2010; however, because many people with gonorrhea are asymptomatic and thus do not get tested, this disease is often underreported [<cite><a href="#CR000416">16</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000420">20</a></cite>]. The CDC estimates that more than 700,000 new gonorrhea infections occur each year [<cite><a href="#CR000420">20</a></cite>]. In 2010, the Southern region of the USA, which includes Texas, had a higher incidence of gonorrhea than the other regions. Nationwide, the incidence of gonorrhea is currently slightly higher among women than men, and age-specific gonorrhea incidence is highest among women aged 15–24 and men aged 20–24 [<cite><a href="#CR000416">16</a></cite>]. The incidence of gonorrhea is nearly 19 times higher among African-Americans, more than 4.5 times higher among Native Americans, and more than twice as high among Hispanics than among non-Hispanic whites [<cite><a href="#CR000416">16</a></cite>]. Like most STDs, the major risk factors for gonorrhea include having unprotected sex and sex with multiple partners [<cite><a href="#CR000420">20</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000421">21</a></cite>].
