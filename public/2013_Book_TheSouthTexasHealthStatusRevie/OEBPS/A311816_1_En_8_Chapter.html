More than one-third of US adults are obese [<cite><a href="#CR00081">1</a></cite>]. Nationwide, the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents has tripled compared to the prevalence observed just one generation ago [<cite><a href="#CR00082">2</a></cite>]. In Texas, 31 % of adults are estimated to be obese. Texas is one of only 12 US states with a percentage of obese adults exceeding 30 % [<cite><a href="#CR00083">3</a></cite>]. Approximately one-third of children in Texas are either overweight or obese [<cite><a href="#CR00084">4</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00085">5</a></cite>].

Obesity is associated with increased risk of a host of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and several different types of cancer [<cite><a href="#CR00088">8</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00089">9</a></cite>]. Because overweight and obesity are usually caused by an energy imbalance (consuming more calories than are used) over a long period of time, poor eating habits and not getting enough physical exercise are two major contributing factors for these conditions [<cite><a href="#CR00089">9</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">African-American and Mexican-American adults in the USA have higher obesity rates than non-Hispanic white adults [<cite><a href="#CR00083">3</a></cite>].

Possible immediate effects of excessive alcohol use (usually the result of binge drinking) include unintentional injuries, violence, damage to a fetus if pregnant, and alcohol poisoning. Long-term health risks include neurological problems, cardiovascular disease, depression, liver disease, and some cancers.

For some cancers, screening has the potential to reduce deaths and morbidity, because treatment of early-stage cancers often has a better prognosis and can be less aggressive than treatment of advanced-stage cancers [<cite><a href="#CR000824">24</a></cite>]. In order for cancer screening to be effective, the test must have the ability to detect cancers earlier than they could be detected as a result of symptoms, and there must be evidence that earlier detection through screening decreases the risk of dying from the disease. Currently, screening tests exist for a number of cancers including breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer.</div><div id="Sec000815" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Breast Cancer Screening (Mammogram)</h3><div class="Para">Although the breast self-exam and clinical breast exam are also screening methods, the mammogram is currently thought to be the best way to screen for breast cancer [<cite><a href="#CR000825">25</a></cite>]. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast, which can detect tumors that are too small to feel. The capability of a mammogram to detect breast cancer depends on tumor size, breast tissue density, and the skill of the radiologist [<cite><a href="#CR000826">26</a></cite>]. Because the incidence of breast cancer increases with age, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that women aged 50 or older have a mammogram every 2 years [<cite><a href="#CR000825">25</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">In 2008 and 2010, an estimated 30.5 % of South Texas women aged 40 or older had not had a mammogram in the past 2 years. This estimate was slightly but not significantly higher than the percentage among women in the rest of Texas (28.1 %) during the same time period. However, both South Texas and the rest of Texas had higher percentages of women who had no mammogram in the past 2 years than was seen nationwide (24 %). A slightly but not significantly higher percentage of Hispanic women in South Texas (31.6 %) were estimated to have not had a mammogram in the past 2 years than non-Hispanic whites (28.2 %).</div></div><div id="Sec000816" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Cervical Cancer Screening (Pap Test)</h3><div class="Para">The Papanicolaou (Pap) test, also called a Pap smear, is the most common screening procedure for cervical cancer. Cells are lightly scraped from the cervix and vagina using a small wooden stick, a brush, or a piece of cotton. The collected cells are then viewed under a microscope to determine if they are normal or abnormal. A Pap test can find the earliest signs of cervical cancer. Because the chance of curing cervical cancer is very high if the cancer is detected early, studies estimate that regular Pap test screening can decrease incidence and mortality of cervical cancer by 80 % or more [<cite><a href="#CR000827">27</a></cite>].Doctors recommend Pap tests for women aged 21 or older, or for women under age 21 who have been sexually active for 3 years or more [<cite><a href="#CR000828">28</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000829">29</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">An estimated 23.3 % of South Texas women aged 18 or older had not had a Pap test in the past 3 years during 2008 and 2010. This South Texas percentage was higher than the percentage of no Pap test in the past 3 years among women in both the rest of Texas (18.3 %) and nation (17.6 %). In South Texas, the percentages of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women who did not have a Pap test in the past 3 years were similar.</div></div><div id="Sec000817" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Prostate Cancer Screening</h3><div class="Para">A couple of screening tests for prostate cancer exist: the digital rectal examination (DRE) and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. However, no standard or routine screening is currently recommended for prostate cancer. This is fact that, although these screening tests are able to find prostate cancer at an early stage, not enough evidence currently exists to determine whether early detection and treatment makes any difference in the outcome of the disease [<cite><a href="#CR000830">30</a></cite>]. Studies to determine the efficacy of prostate cancer screening are currently underway.</div><div id="Sec000818" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Prostate-Specific Antigen Test</h4><div class="Para">A PSA test measures the amount of PSA in the blood. PSA is a protein made by the prostate gland. Although it is common for men to have low levels of PSA in their blood, prostate cancer or other conditions can increase PSA levels. Doctors cannot distinguish between prostate cancer and benign prostate conditions such as inflammation or enlargement of the prostate based on PSA levels alone. However, the PSA test result is taken into account when a doctor makes a decision about whether to do additional tests for prostate cancer. Some doctors encourage PSA tests yearly to screen for prostate cancer, starting anywhere from ages 40–50 [<cite><a href="#CR00088">8</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">In 2008 and 2010, an estimated 47.7 % of men aged 40 and or older had not had a PSA test in the past 2 years. This was very similar to the prevalence of men aged 40 or older who did not have a PSA test in the past 2 years in the rest of Texas (47.4 %). Estimates for South Texas and the rest of Texas were both slightly but not significantly higher than the nationwide prevalence of not having had a PSA test in the past 2 years (45.3 %) (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig000810">8.10</a></span>).

However, it is also another way to screen for prostate cancer and is often performed together with the PSA test to improve the odds of detecting prostate cancer. A doctor performs a digital rectal exam by inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel the prostate gland through the rectal wall for bumps or anything else abnormal [<cite><a href="#CR000830">30</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000831">31</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">In 2008 and 2010, an estimated 46 % of men in South Texas had not had a DRE within the past 5 years. This was higher than the prevalence of no DRE within the last 5 years among men in the rest of Texas (38.5 %) and nation (35.6 %). As with PSA testing, Hispanic males in South Texas were more likely to have not had a DRE exam in the past 5 years (57.5 %) than were non-Hispanic white males (33.9 %).</div></div></div><div id="Sec000820" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Colorectal Cancer Screening</h3><div class="Para">Several tests are regularly used to screen for colorectal cancer, including the fetal occult blood test (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, the double-contrast barium enema (DCBE), and newer techniques such as virtual colonoscopy [<cite><a href="#CR000832">32</a></cite>]. Based on several studies, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found evidence that FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy screening methods are effective in reducing colorectal cancer mortality, and recommends screening using any of these methods for adults aged 50–75 [<cite><a href="#CR000833">33</a></cite>].</div><div id="Sec000821" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Fecal Occult Blood Testing</h4><div class="Para">FOBT is a frequently used noninvasive colorectal cancer screening option that checks for hidden blood in the stool. Stool samples are collected at home, placed on special cards, and are then given back to a doctor or lab for testing. Blood in the stool can be indicative of polyps or cancer [<cite><a href="#CR000832">32</a></cite>]. Studies have found that for persons aged 50–80, having an annual or biennial FOBT may reduce colorectal cancer mortality by up to 33 % [<cite><a href="#CR000834">34</a></cite>]. One of the recommended American Cancer Society colorectal cancer testing options is an annual FOBT for persons aged 50 or older [<cite><a href="#CR000835">35</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">An estimated 83.9 % of individuals aged 50 or older in South Texas had not had a FOBT in the past 2 years in 2008 and 2010. This South Texas prevalence was similar to the prevalence of no FOBT in the rest of Texas (82.7 %) but was significantly higher than the prevalence seen nationwide (80 %). In South Texas, Hispanics had a higher prevalence of not having an FOBT within the past 2 years (87.5 %) than non-Hispanic whites (81 %).</div></div><div id="Sec000822" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Sigmoidoscopy/Colonoscopy</h4><div class="Para">Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are two other common colon cancer screening procedures. Sigmoidoscopy checks the rectum and <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">lower</span> colon by inserting a thin, flexible, lighted instrument in through the rectum. A colonoscopy is an examination of the rectum and <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">whole</span> colon for polyps, cancer, or other abnormalities using a similar thin, lighted instrument [<cite><a href="#CR000832">32</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000834">34</a></cite>]. Both sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy procedures have higher sensitivity than FOBT, and colonoscopy is the most sensitive and specific colorectal cancer test [<cite><a href="#CR000833">33</a></cite>]. However, unlike FOBT, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are both invasive procedures, and colonoscopy in particular has associated risks such as bleeding or perforation of the colon [<cite><a href="#CR000833">33</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000834">34</a></cite>]. Recommended American Cancer Society colorectal cancer testing options for those older than 50 include either a sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, a yearly FOBT, or a colonoscopy every 10 years [<cite><a href="#CR000835">35</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">In South Texas, an estimated 42.8 % of individuals older than 50 had never had a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy in 2008 and 2010.
