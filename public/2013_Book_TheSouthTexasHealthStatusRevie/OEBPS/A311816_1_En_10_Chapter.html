Homicide, especially among young people, is a serious US public health issue [<cite><a href="#CR001010">10</a></cite>]. In 2007, homicide was the second-leading cause of death nationwide in young adults aged 10–24 [<cite><a href="#CR001011">11</a></cite>] and was the third-leading cause of death among adults aged 25–34 [<cite><a href="#CR001012">12</a></cite>]. In 2007, more than 18,000 homicide deaths were reported in the USA [<cite><a href="#CR001010">10</a></cite>], and more than 5,700 of these homicide victims were aged 10–24 [<cite><a href="#CR001011">11</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">Nationwide, males are more than 3.5 times more likely to die from homicide than females.

US homicide rates are highest among young adults aged 20–24. However, among persons younger than 18, a “U”-shaped trend in homicide is seen, with infants having a significantly higher homicide rate (3.6/100,000) than those aged 5–9 (0.7/100,000) and 10–14 (1.0/100,000) [<cite><a href="#CR001014">14</a></cite>]. Other risk factors associated with homicide include living in urban areas, low socioeconomic status, and access to firearms [<cite><a href="#CR001013">13</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR001014">14</a></cite>].</div><div id="Sec00104" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Homicide Mortality in South Texas</h3><div class="Para">Overall, the age-adjusted homicide rate in South Texas (6.0/100,000) was very similar to rates in the rest of Texas (6.1/100,000) and nationwide (6.0/100,000) [<cite><a href="#CR00107">7</a></cite>].
