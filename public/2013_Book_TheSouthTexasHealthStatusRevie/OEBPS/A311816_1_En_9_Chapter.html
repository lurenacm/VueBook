This chapter covers two main environmental exposure health status indicators: elevated child blood lead levels and pesticide exposures.</div><div id="Sec00091" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Childhood Lead Poisoning</h2><div class="Para">Lead is a significant and widespread environmental hazard for all Texas children. Exposure to lead can lead to a number of medical conditions including long-term neurological damage that is often associated with learning and behavioral problems. Blood lead levels ≥10 μg/dL are considered to be elevated, although a child may often not show symptoms, even at higher levels. Very elevated lead levels can result in death. Lead is a ubiquitous toxin with varied exposure sources including dust or chips from lead-based paints, contaminated soil, crafts/hobbies, and home remedy/folk medicines.</div><div class="Para">With increased awareness and efforts to reduce exposure, childhood lead poisoning has decreased in recent years. In 2005, 54,051 US children aged 6 or younger tested with confirmed elevated blood lead levels, compared to 24,375 children in 2009, a decrease of 55 % in 5 years [<cite><a href="#CR00091">1</a></cite>]. Children aged 6 or younger are at greater risk of lead poisoning than older children due to increased absorption, predominant hand-to-mouth behavior, and developing neurological systems. Among US children younger than 6 in 1999–2004, African-American children had a higher percentage of elevated blood lead levels (3.4 %) than did Hispanic children (1.2 %) or non-Hispanic white children (1.2 %) [<cite><a href="#CR00092">2</a></cite>]. Children who live or spend a significant amount of time in pre-1950s housing are at increased risk of childhood lead poisoning. Poverty and living in an area of existing high childhood lead prevalence are also considered surrogate markers for a child’s potential lead exposure risk.</div><div id="Sec00092" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Childhood Lead Poisoning in South Texas</h3><div class="Para">In terms of sheer numbers, Bexar County and the Lower Rio Grande Valley region had the most children aged 0–14 with elevated blood lead levels (&gt;10 μg/dL) in South Texas (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00091">9.1</a></span>). Numbers are most likely greater in these areas because of relatively large population sizes or because of a large percentage of people with low socioeconomic status living in the area.

            </div></div></div><div id="Sec00093" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Work-Related Pesticide Exposure</h2><div class="Para">A pesticide is any substance or combination of substances that is used for preventing, repelling, controlling, or destroying any type of pest. Types of pesticides include not only insecticides but also herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, disinfectants, and sanitizers [<cite><a href="#CR00093">3</a></cite>]. In the USA, about 1.1 billion pounds of pesticide active ingredient are used each year, and more than 20,000 different pesticide products are currently sold nationwide [<cite><a href="#CR00094">4</a></cite>]. Although pesticides are useful to society, they also have the potential to cause great harm to humans, because they are designed to kill or damage living organisms. Health effects vary depending on the type of pesticide involved and the level of exposure. Acute high-level pesticide exposures can cause nausea and vomiting, skin or eye irritation, difficulty breathing, seizures, or even death [<cite><a href="#CR00095">5</a></cite>]. Long-term pesticide exposure effects have been associated with changes in neurobehavioral performance, neurological damage and diseases [<cite><a href="#CR00096">6</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR00097">7</a></cite>], and certain types of cancers [<cite><a href="#CR00098">8</a></cite>]. Children are particularly susceptible to pesticides [<cite><a href="#CR00099">9</a></cite>].</div><div class="Para">Acute pesticide exposures are most commonly occupational exposures. In 2008, the annual rate of work-related pesticide poisonings in the USA was estimated to be 1.5 per 100,000 workers. [<cite><a href="#CR000910">10</a></cite>] Agricultural workers are at especially high risk of pesticide exposure. The annual incidence of pesticide-related illness among agricultural workers from 1998 to 2007 time period was approximately 48/100,000 [<cite><a href="#CR000911">11</a></cite>]. This high incidence among persons employed in agriculture is of particular concern for Hispanics, because 88 % of all farm workers in the USA are Hispanic. Because of pesticide drift, people who live in agricultural areas have a higher risk of pesticide exposure than people who live in nonagricultural areas [<cite><a href="#CR00099">9</a></cite>]. For all occupations combined, males have a slightly higher risk of pesticide-related illness than do females; however, among agricultural workers, the incidence of pesticide-related illness in females is higher than the incidence in males [<cite><a href="#CR000911">11</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR000912">12</a></cite>].</div><div id="Sec00094" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Work-Related Pesticide Exposure in South Texas</h3><div class="Para">Overall, the South Texas working population had a slightly lower incidence of pesticide exposure (0.8 cases per 100,000 population) than did workers in the rest of Texas (1.0/100,000). Hispanics in South Texas had an incidence of pesticide exposure (0.7/100,000) that was comparable to the incidence for Hispanics in the rest of Texas (0.8/100,000) (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00095">9.5</a></span>). In South Texas, the incidence of pesticide exposure was similar between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites (0.7/100,000); however, in the rest of Texas, incidence was slightly but not significantly higher for non-Hispanic whites (1.0/100,000) than for Hispanics (0.8/100,000) (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00095">9.5</a></span>).
