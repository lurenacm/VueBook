                In 1972 the non-governmental organization Club of Rome
                
                  
                
                published the landmark

                (Meadows et al. 1972) a scenario-based analysis of 12 possible world futures to the year 2100. Its key messages were that the human ecological footprint cannot continue to grow for more than 100 years from 1972 at the rapid rate seen from 1900 to 1972; it is possible or even likely that this footprint will overshoot Earth’s sustainable limits; once sustainable limits are overshot, contraction is unavoidable, but overshoot can be avoided through appropriate global policy.
              </div><div class="Para">
                At this moment in 2013 it would appear that our world has in fact followed the business as usual scenario of
                <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Limits to Growth</span>
                
                  
                
                , and that we have long since entered the trajectory of overshoot. Therefore, by the reasoning of
                <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Limits to Growth</span>
                , a contraction of our collective ecological footprint is inevitable, either in the form of a planned contraction or a collapse.
              </div><div class="Para">
                I however believe that if we act, now and with resolution, to solve the pressing trio of energy
                
                  
                
                , resource, and environment problems confronting us, there is still time to avoid a catastrophic future, while at the same time maintaining the standard of living now enjoyed in advanced nations, and allowing the developing countries of the world to reach that same advanced-nation standard. For this reason I have chosen
                <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Beyond the Limits to Growth</span>
                as the title for this English translation of my 2011 book
                <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Nihon Saisouzou</span>
                
                  
                
                (literally,
                <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The Revitalization of Japan</span>
                ) (Komiyama 2009). This book is by no means intended as a criticism or rebuttal of the work of the Club of Rome
                
                  
                
                . Rather, I here present my own (admittedly optimistic) view of how we all, in advanced and developing countries alike, can go about achieving a sustainable world whose development is not constrained.
              </div><div class="Para">
                I believe that it is not only imperative, but also very likely, that new technologies will emerge that will allow us to exceed the limits identified by the Club of Rome
                
                  
                
                and to put societies on a trajectory in which wealth is measured in terms of quality rather than mere quantity. As I discuss in this book, these new technologies will be driven by a novel “creative demand” rather than by conventional “diffusive demand” and this, in turn, will contribute to the shift from quantity to quality in terms of goods produced to meet our needs for energy
                
                  
                
                , materials, and health.
              </div><div class="Para">Let me here explain very briefly why I am optimistic about the future by offering just a few examples from Japan’s experience which may not be well known to non-Japanese readers.</div><div class="Para">Japan rose from the ashes of the Second World War in 1945 to become the world’s second largest economy in 1968 through a post-war economic miracle that began in the first half of the 1950s and continued through the 1960s. This Japanese miracle mirrored a similar phenomenon (the “Wirtschaftswunder”) that also occurred during the same period in post-war West Germany.</div><div class="Para">
                Japan’s post-war economic miracle, however, did not happen without very serious negative consequences, the environmental aspects of which are represented by three of the so-called “Big Four Pollution Diseases of Japan.” These three are (1) Minamata disease,
                
                  
                
                a neurological affliction caused by severe mercury poisoning, which was first identified in 1956 in Minamata City in Kumamoto
                
                  
                
                Prefecture and was caused by methylmercury in wastewater discharges from a chemical factory; (2) a second outbreak of Minamata disease in Niigata Prefecture discovered in 1965; and (3) Yokkaichi
                
                  
                
                asthma, a collection of pulmonary diseases (COPD, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma) caused by sulfur dioxide pollution from petrochemical facilities and refineries in and around the city of Yokkaichi in Mie Prefecture
                
                  
                
                from 1960 to 1972 (Fig.
                <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span>
                ) (The fourth of these Big Four is Itai–itai disease

                The extent of the environmental damage suffered as a consequence of Japan’s rapid economic expansion from the 1950s to the 1970s is by no means limited to only the three epidemics mentioned above. The environmental contamination of the skies and of major bodies of water, such as—among many others—Suruga Bay on the Pacific coast of Honshu near Mount Fuji, the Sumida River running through Tokyo (Fig.
                <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">2</a></span>

                , Dokai Bay

              </div><div class="Para">Faced with these environmental problems, Japanese industry developed the technologies to remove harmful substances from the emissions of industrial facilities and eventually overcame the severe problem of environmental pollution. In Japan, because it came to a situation where people were being directly harmed, the pollution problem had to be solved; the central government imposed emissions regulations on noxious substances, then municipalities topped these with their own strong emissions regulations, and the manufacturing industries complied with these regulations. Today, Japan is not only one of the leading industrialized nations, but it is also a country of clean urban centers and pristine rural landscapes, as the many foreign visitors to Japan each year can attest.</div><div class="Para">
                Just as it overcame grave environmental problems, so too has Japan surmounted equally serious energy

                With proven oil reserves amounting to a mere 44 million barrels, Japan’s reserves would only meet its consumption
                
                  
                
                needs for roughly ten days. As a consequence, Japan imports virtually 100 % of its petroleum. Similarly, Japan produces domestically less than 5 % of the natural gas it consumes, and about one-half of one percent of the coal it consumes.
              </div><div class="Para">
                In fact, Japan has long been heavily reliant on overseas sources for its fossil fuel needs. In 1973 the First Oil Shock

                to skyrocket. Responding to this experience, Japan developed energy
                
                  
                
                -saving technologies that raised energy efficiency and was able to admirably overcome the crisis. In the manufacturing sector, for instance, highly energy-efficient production methods for materials such as cement
                
                  
                
                and steel were born. In processing and assembly industries, the automobile industry developed high fuel-efficiency small cars, building the foundations to later increase international competitiveness.

                production can be reduced. As can be seen in the Fig.
                <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">4</a></span>
                , for instance in the U.S. producing one ton of cement uses 1.6 times the amount of energy used in Japan. The reason is that the U.S. has adopted a policy of holding energy prices down to a cheap level. Likewise, China, which produces more than half the world’s cement, uses 1.6–1.7 times as much energy as Japan.
              </div><div class="Para">
                The very same kinds of cutting-edge solutions have been applied not only to cement

                prices, and in the attempt to surmount this challenge, technological improvement has been relentlessly pursued.

                , I am confident that Japan has what it takes to solve the new problems it now confronts: a graying and shrinking population; the need to create new demand in the face of saturation in demand for existing products; the imperative to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by increasing energy efficiency still further and developing renewable energy sources; the establishment of a material-cycling society to cope with the mineral resource limitations of our finite Earth.
              </div><div class="Para">These solutions will benefit Japan directly, but moreover they can provide a model for the rest of the world, since Japan is in fact coming up against these many problems in advance of other nations; in other words, Japan is not merely an advanced nation saddled with problems, but a nation saddled with problems in advance. In thinking about this background and Japan’s past achievements, I am optimistic that Japan will not remain a “problem-saddled advanced nation,” but rather will use its power to leap forward as a “problem-solving advanced nation”—that is, a forerunner in addressing emerging problems in the world.</div><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Key Features of Our World in the Twenty-First Century</h2><div class="Para">In approaching the many problems discussed in this book, it is important to bear in mind four essential trends that characterize our world as it enters the twenty-first century. Let me offer a brief sketch of these four defining features here.</div><div class="Para">
                  The first feature is the remarkable explosion of wealth that occurred first in what are now the developed nations and that is presently occurring in the developing world. As can be seen in Fig.

                  (GDP) per person (normalized to that of the entire world) from A.D. 1000 to 2008 for the major industrialized nations as well as India and China, there is a familiar pattern to this wealth explosion.

                  For century after century through the Middle Ages per capita GDP was stagnant, but with the advent of the Industrial Revolution

                  and Germany, Italy, and finally Japan, enjoyed almost exponential growth in per capita wealth. Of course these trajectories saw some sharp drops from the effects of depressions and wars, but the pattern is clear. Also striking is the fact that economic growth
                  
                    
                  
                  in the industrialized world has flattened out in recent years.

                  As still-developing nations, China and India stand in contrast to the other nations shown in the graph. Since they did not experience the Industrial Revolution
                  
                    
                  
                  in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, their per capita GDPs relative to that of the entire world actually began a slow decline after approximately 1800. However, it is clear from the shape of their growth curves from the late twentieth century that India and China too are embarking on the same trajectory that the world’s industrialized nations followed decades earlier. We may expect that in time China and India too will reach the status of industrialized nations just as Europe
                  
                    
                  
                  , the United States, and Japan did previously. In the conditions of developed countries, normal citizens have access to food, clothing, shelter, mobility, and information. Once these basic material needs are met, what people desire is satisfaction. I believe that this desire will create new demand for growth.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  The second key feature of our modern world is longevity,
                  
                    
                  
                  a natural consequence of the wealth explosion. Figure

                  shows the change in life expectancy for several countries over time. The huge leaps upward in life expectancy are most pronounced in the industrialized world. For instance, Japan’s life expectancy in 1950 was 61 years, the shortest among industrialized countries, but by 1999—in the span of just two generations—it had jumped to 81 years, at that time the longest in the world.

                </div><div class="Para">Although the gains in longevity are largest in the industrialized world, industrializing nations like India are also enjoying the lengthening of life spans. Just as China, India, and other developing countries are now tracing the upward trajectory in wealth that was experienced earlier in advanced nations, so too will they follow the same course of expanding longevity. Long life in itself is an undeniably good thing. The challenge, as I discuss in this book, will be in re-ordering our societies in such a way that the growing numbers of elderly citizens can find satisfaction in their lives and continue to contribute to community life.</div><div class="Para">
                  The third feature is the saturation of man-made objects
                  
                    
                  
                  that inevitably occurs in developed countries. Whether the man-made object (i.e., the product) is a television, an automobile, housing, or a building material such as cement
                  
                    
                  
                  , when the product is first introduced no one yet possesses it, but it begins to diffuse throughout society and rather quickly reaches the state of saturation, wherein new demand for it can no longer grow. An example of this phenomenon is shown in Fig.

                  shows a similar pattern of growing from near zero but then eventually reaching a plateau, which corresponds to the demand arising from the need to replace old, existing concrete structures. Clearly China is still in a phase of expansion, but someday soon it too will reach saturation. The key issue for the world in the twenty-first century related to this saturation phenomenon will be how to cope with the corresponding demand ceiling. In this book I propose a way out through “creative demand” for new products that will be invented to deal with the needs of the future.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  The fourth and final main feature of the twenty-first century world is the ongoing progression in energy
                  
                    
                  
                  sources that humanity uses to meet its needs. For millennia humankind used biomass in the form of wood. Then with the Industrial Revolution
                  
                    
                  
                  began the widespread use of coal, which is still very much with us today as a fuel for base load electricity production. For other purposes, such as rail and sea transportation, coal steadily gave way to petroleum beginning in the early twentieth century. Recent years have seen the increased use of natural gas

                  It seems quite likely to me that the world will undergo a shift from fossil-based fuel sources to renewable fuel sources in the twenty-first century. This will happen as a result both of the slow depletion of non-renewable and low-cost fossil sources, and also of humankind’s efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. How this fundamental shift in the world’s energy

                  In Chap. 1 I begin by explaining the true nature of the demand shortage
                  
                    
                  
                  in advanced nations. Introducing the concepts of “diffusive demand” and “creative demand”—namely, demand for things that already exist and demand for things that have not yet taken shape, respectively—I explain that diffusive demand will necessarily saturate as a given man-made object, such as an automobile, a house, or a television, reaches every part of the population in sufficient quantity. When a man-made object reaches saturation, new demand, which arises when people who do not possess something acquire it for the first time, vanishes, leaving only replacement
                  
                    
                  
                  demand, which comes from replacing or renewing something acquired previously. Concrete examples of the saturation process for housing, automobiles, and televisions
                  
                    
                  
                  in Japan and other advanced nations are given. I argue that the fundamental shift in the nature of demand to replacement or renewal demand, caused by the saturation of population and of man-made objects, lies at the heart of the demand shortage that plagues advanced economies.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Moreover, many advanced nations such as Japan are now seeking relief from the demand shortage
                  
                    
                  
                  s they are experiencing in their saturated domestic markets by expanding into developing countries such as China and India. However, by looking in detail at examples such as cement
                  
                    
                  
                  and automobiles, I show that developing nations like China are themselves following the same trajectory toward saturation that Japan once traced. Therefore, sooner or later China and other developing nations will likewise reach a condition of saturation.
                </div><div class="Para">Furthermore, because the quantity of demand is necessarily higher before the saturation condition is reached as compared to after it is reached, an overcapacity of production is bound to be introduced in the pre-saturation phase that will saddle the economy in the post-saturation phase. As an example, Japan’s automobile industry has been able to cope thus far with the saturation of the domestic market (and accompanying domestic production overcapacity) by using the excess capacity for exports first to the United States, and now to China, and to India in the future. But because the global market will saturate one day, likely sooner than is generally thought, this is not a sustainable strategy for all time.</div><div class="Para">
                  Having described the above situation, I suggest at the close of the first chapter that a solution for Japan lies in stimulating “creative demand” for products that have not yet come into existence. In fact, because problem-saddled developed country Japan is preceding the rest of the world in running into problems of a graying society, and energy
                  
                    
                  
                  and resource scarcity, and the environment, it is in an optimal position to generate new “creative demand” by working out solutions to these burdensome issues. Indeed, it is this very demand that will become the foundation on which Japan can break loose from the past decades of economic stagnation

                  In Chap. 2 the discussion continues with the identification of what I believe the new paradigms
                  
                    
                  
                  of the twenty-first century will be: exploding knowledge

                  society. Chapter 2 considers in detail the first of these paradigms, that of exploding knowledge. Although the explosive growth in human knowledge has been undeniably beneficial, it has brought with it a negative legacy as well: the problem that an increase in knowledge has made it extremely difficult to grasp the whole picture.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Furthermore, by discussing the past Nobel Prize
                  
                    
                  
                  -winning achievements of the discovery of penicillin, the invention of the transistor, and the meson theory of nuclear interactions, as compared to the more recent neutrino experiments, I argue that as science has developed and become compartmentalized into numerous specialized areas, the distance between human values and science has gradually increased.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Since it is unlikely that we will ever get rid of compartmentalization, what is important is whether we can integrate a vast body of compartmentalized knowledge
                  
                    
                  
                  in accordance with our objectives and create the whole picture as a solution for achieving our objectives. Humanity must work seriously on creating a method that makes this possible; I call this method of integrating compartmentalized knowledge “knowledge structuring.” Humanity will be able to solve many of the problems it confronts today if knowledge is structured, if Information Technologies
                  
                    
                  
                  (IT)—which is particularly good at accumulating and searching for information—is used successfully, and if meaningful discussions are carried out that can bring a flash of insight, neither deductive nor inductive, from a small number of clues at hand.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Since the end of the twentieth century, the speed of information transmission has exceeded the speed at which Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” operates—the mechanism by which the free market achieves an optimal distribution of resources through intermediaries of the price, regardless of individual wills. In consequence, as was revealed by the financial crisis in 2008, a mechanism has been established whereby the informationally strong obtain information instantly by taking advantage of an information divide (informal gap) and use it to exploit the informationally weak. As a result, the market, far from coming into equilibrium, has often run away and become more uncertain. The consequences of this acceleration of information speed on the energy

In a similar way, information technology may be able to provide fundamental means for solving problems in many areas besides medical care, including education, transportation, and agriculture.</div><div class="Para">
                  Chapter 3 takes up the second of the big paradigms

                  , resources, and global warming. “Vision 2050” is a comprehensive model for achieving sustainable societies, which was originally proposed in 1999 (Komiyama 1999). This model has been disseminated not only as the Japanese-version original book, but also in an English version as well as a Chinese version (Komiyama and Kraines 2009) (Komiyama 2001). Under assumptions of growth in developing nations and maintenance of living standards in developed nations, the model envisions attaining sustainability
                  
                    
                  
                  by 2050 by meeting three main challenges: (1) triple energy efficiency, (2) build a system for material cycling, and (3) double the use of non-fossil fuels.

                  during product use, we show that in the future, even if the number of vehicles in the world grows to triple the current number, because the amount of gasoline consumed by each is expected to be one tenth the level now, the total energy used will be about one third. Similarly, taking cement
                  
                    
                  
                  as an example of energy used to produce something, it is seen that there is still great room for reducing energy consumption in manufacturing through the adoption of advanced technology. The improvement of the entire world’s energy efficiency can be brought about by the development of state-of-the-art technology and the transfer of established technology.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  The construction of a “material cycle system,” i.e. a recycling society, is next explained. Considering the costs of manufacture vs. recycling for steel and aluminum, the two metals used in greatest quantity, we show that recycling vastly reduces energy

                  ” are no urban myth, as discarded industrial objects contain a much higher concentration of precious materials like gold and lithium than mineral ores do. Three requirements are necessary to successfully re-circulate resources: a societal system for recovering resources, product design that allows for easy separation of resources, and the technology for separation.

                  Turning to the third goal of doubling the use of non-fossil energy
                  
                    
                  
                  , we note that in around 2050 roughly three times more energy than now will be used on Earth, but consistent with the first “Vision 2050” aim of tripling energy efficiency, the total amount of energy consumed in 2050 will be no different from the present. Given this, the proposal of “Vision 2050” is to reduce the share of fossil fuels from the current 80 to 60 %, and to raise the share of non-fossil fuels from 20 to 40 %. Nuclear fission will likely be necessary as a transitional energy source until the twenty-second century. I further argue that there are only four types of renewable energy that during the twenty-first century can grow to the scale of at least one percent of total energy supply: hydro, solar, wind, and biomass. Regarding biomass, I explain why using food crops for fuel is not an option; instead I propose that for the large-scale introduction of biomass, using seawater to grow algae in the desert is full of promise.

                  It is shown that carrying out “Vision 2050” will lead to a 25 % reduction in worldwide carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, leading to a carbon dioxide concentration of 460 ppm. This stands in sharp contrast to a business-as-usual scenario (really a breakdown scenario) in which emissions more than triple and the carbon dioxide concentration reaches 600 ppm. I argue that this is a vision on which advanced and developing nations can agree, as energy

At the same time, in keeping with the due right of developing nations to continue growing in order to become advanced nations, the two-thirds reduction of energy consumption in the developed world will be allotted to developing nations to support their economic growth

Next the Galapagos syndrome is discussed, referring to the fact that Japanese products, in spite of their high performance, have not become the global standard as they have evolved endemically in an island and are highly priced. One key cause of the high price is the large number of Japanese manufacturers of a given product, leading to small production volumes for a given unit and therefore a higher unit cost. This problem could possibly be solved by bringing about a consolidation of manufacturers in an industry into perhaps two companies. Related to this issue of the need for company consolidation, the recent declining state of the Japanese solar panel industry is also discussed.

It is absolutely vital to think thoroughly about how to forestall the low-cost imitation of these products by overseas makers and seize the global market, on the assumption that ENE-FARM and Eco-Cute will be copied. Specifically, an attempt should be made to reduce costs through their introduction to the Japanese market through citizens’ action and governmental support.

Scientific research results indicate that people can age in good health if five conditions are met: (1) nutrition, (2) exercise, (3) communication with others, (4) openness to new concepts, and (5) positive thinking. These conditions can be called the “five conditions for happy aging.”

Since school teachers today are stretched by their duties, participation in school education by people having sufficient social experience would produce significant synergies in coordination with teachers. Moreover, in recent years educational venues have been losing diversity both on the teachers’ side and on the students’ side; people with more diverse experiences, such as senior citizens, might help to correct this situation.</div><div class="Para">It is advisable to send about three sufficiently experienced working people, for instance, to each elementary school or junior high school as instructors to give lessons at least three times a week. In the new educational system, once chosen as teachers, experienced working people would of course take charge of fewer class sessions than regular school teachers, but should be prepared to stand on the lecture platform even for a single class session throughout the year. Their annual income might be $10,000 to $20,000 at most: many senior citizens have generous financial resources, including annuities, and thus want to contribute something to society rather than expect monetary rewards. The point is that the involvement of committed senior citizens in education would contribute significantly to bringing diversity to educational venues, as well as making their lives worth living.</div><div class="Para">

Not all products need to be evaluated globally on the basis of price alone. In discussions over globalization, we tend only to fear that price competition would prevail in the market, eliminating less competitive businesses. I believe that markets will be divided into two groups in the future—one that is standardized globally and is composed of globally competitive markets and the other which consists of localized markets.

However, their activities would not bear fruit if they are carried out separately in individual regions, because the amount of data and information owned by each region is so limited that sufficient demand would not be generated to create new industries or raise a voice strong enough to reform the legal and social systems. Thus the Platinum Society Network was established in 2010 to facilitate the solution of common issues facing various regions through exchange of information and ideas. The accumulated efforts of all regions to improve daily lives would stimulate enormous demand to develop new industries.

                  For instance, let us consider the pollution issue. Japan is an advanced industrial country where land is limited and many people dwell. Because a large number of people reside near factories, pollution problems readily occur. Even in such countries as the United States, Russia, or China that have vast land area, many harmful substances like sulfur oxides are discharged. However, even if the forests die out, because not many people live close to industrial areas, the direct harm inflicted on people is limited. In Japan’s case, during the period of high economic growth

                  , Sumida River, and Lake Kasumigaura, among other bodies of water, was dreadful. It is no exaggeration to say that the pollution of that era extended to the entire country.
                </div><div class="Para">Faced with this problem, industry developed the technologies to remove harmful substances and overcame environmental pollution. In Japan, because it came to a situation where people were being directly harmed, the pollution problem had to be solved; the central government imposed emission regulations on harmful substances, then municipalities topped these with their own strong emission regulations, and the manufacturing industries complied with these regulations.</div><div class="Para">
                  The same may be said regarding energy
                  
                    
                  
                  , as well. Japan imports nearly 100 % of its petroleum. In 1973 the First Oil Shock
                  
                    
                  
                  , and then in 1979 the Second Oil Shock, occurred, causing the price of crude oil
                  
                    
                  
                  to skyrocket. Responding to this experience, Japan developed energy-saving technologies that raised energy efficiency and admirably overcame the crisis. In the manufacturing sector, for instance, highly energy-efficient production methods for materials such as cement
                  
                    
                  
                  and steel were born. In processing and assembly industries, the automobile industry developed high fuel-efficiency small cars, building the foundations to later increase international competitiveness.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  To take the steel industry as an example, the technology for blast furnaces originally used to make steel was essentially introduced from overseas, but the production methods that increased energy
                  
                    
                  
                  efficiency were researched and developed in Japan. In the steel-making of former times, when a thin sheet was being made, after the iron from the blast furnace was first cooled, its temperature was then raised and the metal worked in a process that was repeated again and again. But once the continuous casting method was developed, it became possible to work the steel into a finished product in one stroke without, to the extent possible, cooling the steel. This continuous casting method (also called “strand casting” in English) contributed the most greatly to the improvement of energy efficiency in steel-making.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Furthermore, the technology known as blast furnace top-pressure recovery turbine (TRT) generation was developed, further raising energy
                  
                    
                  
                  efficiency. In this top-pressure electricity generation, the blast furnaces of a steel mill are used as a source of power. The gas from a blast furnace generated in the process of making steel has a high pressure; at this pressure the gas is used to turn a turbine generator and make electricity.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Moreover, the coke necessary for making steel is produced by placing the raw material—finely grained coal powder—into a furnace and baking it. In that process the coke emerges from the furnace red-hot, and it is cooled by blowing argon gas over it. Because the argon gas blown over the coke contains heat, this heat too is put to use. Since every possible means, such as these, to raise the energy
                  
                    
                  
                  efficiency have been devised, Japan has been able to realize the world’s highest energy-efficient plants.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  The very same kinds of means have been applied not only to steel-making, but to many of Japan’s manufacturing industries. Why did this become so? It is because Japan had to deal with high energy
                  
                    
                  
                  prices, and in the attempt to surmount this challenge, technological development has been incessantly carried out.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Japan possesses the experience of having solved the environmental pollution and energy
                  
                    
                  
                  problems, and so now it is able to sell these technologies overseas.
                </div><div class="Para">The size of Japan’s economy reached the rank of No. 2 in the world in 1968. At that time Japan, already a problem-saddled advanced nation, was not crushed by these problems, but rather recorded a splendid history of fostering competitiveness by solving these problems.</div><div class="Para">In the background that made this possible are a diligent national character and the strength of public consensus to undertake technological development in order to solve problems. Although there are a number of problems in Japan’s educational system, viewed internationally the Japanese level of education is generally high. In this sense, in Japan there does exist fundamental human talent.</div><div class="Para">In thinking about this background and these achievements, I am confident that Japan will not remain a “problem-saddled advanced nation,” but rather will use its power to leap forward as a “problem-solving advanced nation”—that is, a forerunner in addressing emerging problems in the world.</div></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Good Fortune of Being Located in Asia, the Core of Economic Growth</h2><div class="Para">In addition, what is favorable for Japan is that the problems Japan now has on its hands will be the problems that the future world will confront.</div><div class="Para">If the world continues on its current path, the population increase of developing nations and rising incomes will probably combine to cause the environment of the entire world to worsen, resources to run short, society’s graying to grow more serious—the entire world will fall into the same condition that Japan now finds itself in.</div><div class="Para">
                  Taking for instance the problem of an aging
                  
                    
                  
                  population due to a low birth rate, Japan’s total fertility rate is 1.41 children per woman. For China, which adopted its one-child policy, the rate is 1.58 and for South Korea, which has become an advanced country, it is 1.30, falling short by a wide margin of the 2.08 necessary to sustain a population. (The data for Japan is as of 2012; for China, as of 2011; for South Korea, as of 2012.) South Korea is forecast to enter the era of the graying population around 2020, and China around 2030.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Generally the graying of society exerts a negative influence on economic activity. The burdens of pensions, health care, and nursing grow larger. But it goes without saying that longevity itself is a delightful thing. For elderly citizens and for society alike, can a workable aging
                  
                    
                  
                  society be realized or not? Therein lies the question. There is absolutely no doubt that this realization of a good aging society is a challenge that, mobilizing all its heretofore cultivated wisdom, humanity must take up.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  Hence, it is necessary for humankind as well that Japan solve the problems now confronting it. Examples of such solutions include high energy
                  
                    
                  
                  -efficiency production technologies and product development, the spread of energy-economizing homes, new tailor-made medical treatments, transportation and medical systems that can deal with both depopulated and overcrowded areas, as well as the creation of new manufacturing industries and social systems that can support an aging
                  
                    
                  
                  society.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  For Japan the point more advantageous than any other is that it lies in Asia, the engine of global economic growth
                  
                    
                  
                  for the time being. This surely is a blessing of fortune for Japan.
                </div><div class="Para">Let us for instance consider medical care. In general, it is believed that if one’s cholesterol level is high, the probability of a cerebral hemorrhage occurring is elevated, but this conclusion was derived based on data pertaining to Westerners. So long as the investigation is restricted to Westerners, indeed a connection can be inferred between high cholesterol levels and the incidence of the disease.</div><div class="Para">On the other hand, what is the situation for the case of the Japanese? Compared to Westerners, cholesterol levels overall are low, and there is not much correlation with incidence of cerebral hemorrhage. For Japanese, it is said that what is important is not whether the cholesterol level is high or low, but changes in the level. If levels begin to rise, caution is warranted.</div><div class="Para">As can be understood from this example, in Japan the development of medical treatment based on data not only for Westerners, but for Japanese, is necessary.</div><div class="Para">In the field of gene therapy, it is becoming clear from recent research that the gene arrangement of Japanese is closer to Chinese and Koreans than to Westerners.</div><div class="Para">In this way, there is a context for data analyzed in Japan or for treatments developed in Japan to be readily accepted in the Asian region.</div><div class="Para">
                  The same may be said not only for medical treatment but for housing as well. If one is to attempt to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from households, it is necessary to build homes with high energy
                  
                    
                  
                  efficiency. In doing so, if we consider the climate in which the homes are located, compared to cool, dry Europe
                  
                    
                  
                  and North America, Japan—with its hot, humid summers and dry winters—is fundamentally more similar to other Asian regions.
                </div><div class="Para">
                  In particular, because Japan stretches in a long north–south arc from Hokkaido to Okinawa and moreover mountain ranges run through the center of the archipelago, although at the same longitude Japan’s area encompasses diverse climates. For just about anywhere in Asia, there is a place in Japan with a similar climate. Thus, if housing construction and town planning in each of Japan’s regions is carried out in a manner befitting the local climate, the knowledge
                  
                    
                  
                  and technology created in the process can easily be introduced into other Asian countries.
                </div><div class="Para">For these and similar reasons, Japan’s being located in Asia may be said to be a stroke of good luck.</div></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Many Countries Harbor Warm Sentiments Toward Japan</h2><div class="Para">In thinking about overseas development, there is something of which almost no Japanese are aware. Namely, the fact that foreigners’ feelings toward Japan are extremely favorable. This too works to Japan’s advantage.</div><div class="Para">Recently, when I visited Brunei, the feelings toward Japan were excellent. Whether visiting Thailand, Vietnam, or other Southeast Asian nations, or India, or Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other Arab nations, the feelings toward Japan are extremely good. A great many Japanese do no evil, and are gentle by temperament. They like cleanliness, and act reliably when working together in a group.</div><div class="Para">But many Japanese believe that foreign feelings toward Japan are poor. This is because anti-Japanese sentiments of Korea and China are exaggerated and widely reported. And indeed, anti-Japanese sentiment in general in both Korea and China cannot be denied. However, even in the case of Korea, since around the time of the joint sponsorship of the soccer World Cup in 2002, the situation has been considerably changing. I think that going forward this will largely change in China too. From manga and anime to video games and the novels of Haruki Murakami, and even to safe and delicious food, longings for Japanese culture in a broad sense are growing stronger among the Chinese people.</div><div class="Para">
                  In a 2010 survey conducted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on which countries have a beneficial effect on the world, Germany came out on top, followed by the Europe
                  
                    
                  
                  an Union and Japan in second place, and Canada in third. As far as which countries were disliked, Japan did rank higher than Germany, the European Union, and Canada, but this is because many Chinese and Korean name Japan as a country they do not like. All the same, generally speaking the world estimates highly Japan’s having accomplished its modernization after the Meiji Restoration and leaping even into the global top class as a non-Western nation.
                </div><div class="Para">The Japanese need to recognize this fact. If Japan can transition from “problem-saddled advanced nation” to “problem-solving advanced nation” and if it spreads these societal and technological solutions to the rest of the world, this will bring a truly favorable wind to our situation. For this very reason, for the sake of the entire world as well, we must now boldly take up the challenge of solving the problems we now face. This challenge will bring us new opportunities for growth.</div><div class="Para">
