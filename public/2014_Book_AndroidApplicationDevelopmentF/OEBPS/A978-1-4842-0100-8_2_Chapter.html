The core of the Medfield platform is the SoC chip (code-named Penwell). In fact, the previous Moorestown platform requires a two-chip solution to achieve the same functionality. As a true SoC, Medfield is different from the single-chip layout of Intel Atom processors but is equivalent to previous chipsets. As a result, it becomes a more compact, energy-efficient processor. The Medfield SoC processor adopts package on package (POP), and the entire chip area is about 12 × 12 mm. The internal architecture of Medfield SoC is shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">2-6</a></span>.<div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO6"><img src="A978-1-4842-0100-8_2_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="A978-1-4842-0100-8_2_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></div><div class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-6.</span><div class="SimplePara">Internal architecture of Penwell SoC</div></div></div></div>
            </div><div class="Para">The first Medfield SoC, built for smartphones, has an Intel Atom processor Z2460. The plan is to use the latest Intel Atom processors in future Medfield SoCs. For example, the plan for the second Medfield SoC is to adopt the Intel Atom processor Z2610 and has applications for mainstream tablets. Medfield SoC uses a 32 nm processor; integrates a single-core Intel Atom processor, 512 KB L2 cache, PowerVR SGX540 GPU by Imagination Technologies, and dual-channel LPDDR2 memory controller; and supports 30 fps 1080p video decoding. The highest frequency of Intel Atom processors is limited to 1.6 GHz. The Z2460 may reduce the minimum frequency to 100 MHz, features 1.3 GHz standard operating frequency, and only operates in 1.6 GHz during acceleration mode. As the second Medfield SoC core, the Z2610 maintains operation at 1.6 GHz clock speed.</div><div class="Para">The Intel Atom processor Z2460 consumes 50 mW of power at 100 MHz clock speed (lowest frequency); 175 mW at 600 MHz clock speed; 500 mW at 1.3 GHz clock speed (standard frequency); and 750 mW at 1.6 GHz clock speed (highest frequency). Compared with desktop processors, the Z2460 has very low power consumption.</div><div class="Para">Today, the Android OS completely supports Medfield. Intel works with Google to develop software for compiling applications for ARM and Intel architectures.</div></div><div id="Sec16" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Bay Trail</h3><div class="Para">Bay Trail, the new Intel multi-core SoC built on the Silvermont architecture, is from Intel’s powerful processor family for mobile and desktop devices. Bay Trail is manufactured on Intel’s industry-leading tri-gate 22 nm process technology.</div><div class="Para">Bay Trail is a multi-core SoC that integrates the next-generation Intel processor core, graphics, memory, and I/O interfaces into one solution. It is also Intel’s first SoC that is based on the 22 nm processor technology. This multi-core Intel Atom processor provides outstanding computing power and is more power efficient compared to its predecessors. In addition to the latest Intel architecture core technology, it provides extensive platform features such as graphics, connectivity, security, and sensors, which enable developers to create software with unlimited user experiences.</div></div></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">64-Bit Android OS on Intel Architecture</h2><div class="Para">On a generic level, there are not many significant differences between 64-bit and 32-bit processors. But compute-intensive applications (later, the chapter discusses software workloads that run faster on 64-bit processors) can see significant improvements when moved from 32-bit to 64-bit. In almost all cases, 64-bit applications run faster in a 64-bit environment than 32-bit applications in a 64-bit environment, which is a good enough reason for developers to care about it. Utilizing platform capabilities can improve the speed of applications that perform a large number of computations.</div><div id="Sec18" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">64 Bits vs. 32-bit Android</h3><div class="Para">A 64-bit architecture means the width of the integer registers and pointers is 64 bits. The three main advantages of a 64-bit operating system are as follows:<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet"><li><div class="Para">Increased number of registers</div></li><li><div class="Para">Extended address space</div></li><li><div class="Para">Increased RAM</div></li></ul></div>
            </div><div class="Para">It’s not hard to imagine Android phones with 64-bit chips in the not-too-distant future. Because the Android kernel is based on a Linux kernel, and Linux has supported 64-bit technology for years, the only thing Android needs to fully support 64-bit processing is to make the Dalvik VM 64-bit compatible. A Dalvik application (written only in Java) will work without any changes on a 64-bit device because the bytecode is platform independent.</div><div class="Para">Native application developers can take full advantage of the capabilities offered by the underlying processor. For example, Intel Advanced Vector Extensions (Intel AVX) has been extended to support a 256-bit instruction size on 64-bit processors.</div></div><div id="Sec19" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Memory and CPU Register Size</h3><div class="Para">Memory is extremely slow compared to the CPU, and reading from and writing to memory can take a long time compared to how long it takes the CPU to process an instruction. CPUs try to hide this with layers of caches, but even the fastest layer of cache is slow compared to internal CPU registers. More registers means more data can be kept purely CPU-internal, reducing memory accesses and increasing performance.</div><div class="Para">Just how much difference this makes depends on the specific code in question, as well as how good the compiler is at optimizing the code to make the best use of available registers. When the Intel architecture moved from 32-bit to 64-bit, the number of registers doubled from 8 to 16, and this made for a substantial performance improvement.</div><div class="Para">Sixty-four-bit pointers allow applications to address larger RAM address spaces: typically, on a 32-bit processor, the addressable memory space available to a program is between 1 and 3 GB because only 4 GB is addressable. Even if 1–3 GB is available, a single program cannot use all the memory that is addressable unless it resorts to a technique like splitting the program into multiple processes, which takes a lot of programming effort. On a 64-bit operating system, this is of no concern because the addressable memory space is pretty large.</div><div class="Para">Memory-mapped files are becoming more difficult to implement on 32-bit architectures because files over 4 GB are increasingly common. Such large files cannot be memory-mapped easily to 32-bit architectures—only part of the file can be mapped into the address space at a time. To access such a file, the mapped parts must be swapped into and out of the address space as needed. This is a problem because memory mapping, if properly implemented by the OS, is one of the most efficient disk-to-memory methods.</div><div class="Para">Sixty-four-bit pointers also come with a substantial downside: most programs use more memory because pointers need to be stored and they consume twice as much memory. An identical program running on a 64-bit CPU takes more memory than on a 32-bit CPU. Because pointers are very common in programs, this can increase cache sizes and have an impact on performance.</div><div class="Para">Register count can strongly influence performance of an application. RAM is slow compared to on-CPU registers. CPU caches help to increase the speed of applications, but accessing cache does result in a performance hit.</div><div class="Para">The amount of the performance increase is dependent on how well the compiler can optimize for a 64-bit environment. Compute-intensive applications that are able to do the majority of their processing in a small amount of memory see significant performance increases because a large percentage of the application can be stored on the CPU registers.</div><div class="Para">Contrast this with an unoptimized application that might see a decrease in computer performance because 64-bit pointers require twice the bandwidth. However, in a mobile environment, the OS and installed applications should be engineered to avoid this. A famous example of a large program that runs slower on a 64-bit environment is the Oracle JVM.</div><div class="Para">Both ARM and Intel 64-bit CPUs have a 32-bit compatibility mode. Although 32-bit applications will run on 64-bit processors, compiling with a 64-bit optimizing compiler allows them to take advantage of the architectural benefits of a 64-bit environment.</div></div></div><div id="Sec20" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Reference Platform for Intel Embedded Systems</h2><div class="Para">The so-called <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">reference platform</span> for Intel embedded systems is a wide range of hardware devices that use the Intel Atom processor and SoC. This hardware combination features compact size, low power consumption, high performance, low cost, and an excellent chipset for graphics processing and other specialized sectors. Thus it can be widely used in diversified embedded devices such as netbooks, nettops, tablets, mobile phones, and MIDs.</div><div id="Sec21" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Internet of Things (IoT) and Next Unit of Computing (NUC)</h3><div class="Para">The Internet of Things (IoT) and Next Unit of Computing (NUC)are recent application sectors for Intel Mobile processors.

A fanless kit with flash storage built in, USB3 support, and audio headset support, this Intel NUC fits right at home in schools, call centers, and other locations with a large installed base of VGA monitors.</div><div class="Para">Powered by the Intel Atom processor E3815, the Intel NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE also provides an ideal combination of power consumption, performance, affordability, and software compatibility to drive light digital signage, point-of-sale, and kiosk solutions, among other usages. With 4 GB of embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC) storage built in, many embedded applications will benefit from a lower overall system-level BOM cost. The high-availability resilience can also be enabled for these and other unattended solutions via the built-in watchdog timer, providing protection against downtime. This Intel NUC provides a discrete Trusted Platform Module device onboard for hardware-based data encryption—a must-have for applications where confidential information is at stake.</div><div id="Sec22" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Intel Galileo Development Kit for IoT</h4><div class="Para">The Intel Galileo development board, shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig8">2-8</a></span>, is Intel’s first product in a new family of Arduino-compatible development boards featuring Intel architecture.

Used for inventory control and chain-of-custody tracking, such tagging will play a significant role in healthcare, pharmaceutical management and delivery, and the transportation industry. One of the advantages of RFID tags over traditional barcodes is that a tag interrogator can both read and write a tag from a distance of tens of meters or more. To date, tag interrogators have been custom devices that require costly, vendor-specific integration with back-end inventory systems.
