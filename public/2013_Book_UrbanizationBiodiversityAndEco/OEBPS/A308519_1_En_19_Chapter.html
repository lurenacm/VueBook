With over 20 million people in the metropolitan region, NYC nevertheless has rich biodiversity that provides a broad suite of ecosystem services, with new assessments of biodiversity underway in city government, NGOs, and universities. NYC contains the most parkland of any U.S. city and currently about 21 % of the city is covered by tree canopy. PlaNYC, the environmental and economic sustainability plan for NYC, set a goal of planting one million new trees by 2017, with the hope that canopy cover will reach 30 % by 2030. However, significant challenges to local and regional biodiversity remain, including pollution, climate change, sea level rise, stormwater management, and human population growth. Nonetheless, NYC has made progress in improving the environmental quality of its urban ecosystems and in the provisioning of a broad range of urban ecosystem services. Three elements are key to this progress: (1) coherent governmental support in the form of an overarching long-term planning document, PlaNYC and the NYC Green Infrastructure Plan; (2) systematic investment in natural areas, green infrastructure and civic engagement by a rich variety of organizations; and (3) a commitment to the acquisition of data that facilitate informed decision-making.</div></div><div class="KeywordGroup" xml:lang="en"><div class="Heading">Keywords</div><span class="Keyword">Biodiversity</span><span class="Keyword">Ecosystem services</span><span class="Keyword">Green infrastructure</span><span class="Keyword">PlaNYC</span></div><div class="ArticleNote ArticleNoteMisc"><div class="SimplePara">

NYC is both a complex social-ecological system and one of the world’s great cultural and economic centers.</div><div class="Para">NYC’s founding humans have extensively altered the landscape (Sanderson and Brown <cite><a href="#CR65">2007</a></cite>). The watershed in which NYC exists was almost entirely forested in 1609 with small areas in agricultural cultivation by Native Americans. By 1880, approximately 68 % of the watershed had been converted to farmland, but as soil productivity declined and industry created new jobs, much of cleared land gradually reverted to secondary forest. The local rivers and streams were widely dammed for agriculture, milling, fishing, power, and drinking water.</div><div class="Para">Inspired by Burnham’s plan for Chicago, the NYC Regional Plan Association created the world’s second urban plan. NYC was an early leader in urban park development in the mid-1800s, including Central Park and Prospect Park, designed by the famous landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmstead. In the 1950s and 1960s, pioneering New Yorkers and others began outlining ways to encourage healthier, cleaner, and more sustainable modes of living. NYC owes its current sustainability vision to the foundations laid by William Whyte’s <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The Exploding Metropolis</span>, Jane Jacob’s <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</span>, and Ian McHarg’s <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Design with Nature</span>, all of whom used NYC as their laboratory for articulating the goals of livable and sustainable cities (McPhearson <cite><a href="#CR27">2011</a></cite>).</div></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.2 </span>The New York City Social-Ecological System</h2><div class="Para">(Note that NYC will refer henceforth to the municipality)</div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeOverview"><div class="Heading">New York City: Population</div><div class="Para">

Over 800 languages are spoken in NYC, the most linguistically diverse city in the world (Roberts <cite><a href="#CR61">2010</a></cite>). NYC’s continued growth is supported by an energetic economy; the area’s GDP in 2010 was approximately US$1.4 trillion (<cite><a href="#CR11">Greyhill Advisors n.d.</a></cite>), the largest regional economy in the U.S. and the second largest city economy in the world (Hoehn et al. <cite><a href="#CR16">2009</a></cite>).</div><div class="Para">NYC lies at the confluence of several waterways that form one of the world’s largest natural harbors, which is used extensively for import and export (Kurlansky <cite><a href="#CR22">2006</a></cite>).

As the seas rise and storm surges become more common, beaches and bluffs will suffer increased erosion, severe flooding and storm will disrupt public transit, and increased threat of saltwater infiltration into surface waters and aquifers will affect biodiversity (Frumhoff et al. <cite><a href="#CR9">2007</a></cite>).</div></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.3.3 </span>Stormwater</h3><div class="Para">Stormwater runoff is a major contributor to water quality degradation in urban areas (<cite><a href="#CR41">NYS Department of Environmental Conservation n.d.</a></cite>). Seventy two percent of NYC’s land area is covered by impervious surfaces (Alamarie et al. <cite><a href="#CR1">2011</a></cite>). Like many mature cities, much of NYC has a “combined” wastewater treatment system. During heavy precipitation, the storm sewers overflow into the sanitary sewers, mixing stormwater and untreated sewage (combined sewage overflows, or CSOs), releasing them into local waterways.</div><div class="Para">Rain events as small as 0.15 in. can trigger such events. Each year, more than 27 billion gallons of CSOs are diverted into the harbor (Plumb <cite><a href="#CR58">2006</a></cite>), causing significant eutrophication (Howarth et al. <cite><a href="#CR058">2000</a></cite>) and limiting recreation. Management of CSOs is of paramount importance for safeguarding aquatic biodiversity and a wide variety of ecosystem services. Therefore, the City’s Department of Environmental Protection has invested over US$9 billion in reducing CSOs since 2002. PlaNYC, discussed below, is relying heavily on a combination of updated conventional “gray” infrastructure (such as increased capacity at treatment plants) and “green” infrastructure (see Sect. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Sec27">19.6.1</a></span> below) technologies to reduce CSOs.</div></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.3.4 </span>Air Quality</h3><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1"><div class="Heading">Health Consequences of Poor Air Quality</div><div class="Para">

Hundreds of miles of riparian corridors were developed, headwater streams were filled and piped, and higher order streams were straightened and disconnected from their floodplains through typical urban development. Comparing current stream mapping to historical mapping (Eymund Deigel, personal communication) between 40 and 90 % of streams in NYC have been buried or filled at a proportion approximately equivalent to the impervious area in the landscape. The greatest intact stream length remains in Staten Island, but even there most streams have been extensively modified directly or indirectly.</div><div class="Para">Since the Clean Water Act the rate of wetlands loss has been dramatically reduced in NYC, as around the U.S. Nevertheless, incremental filling of State unregulated wetlands (wetlands smaller than 12.5 acres) and development in the wetland buffer areas has continued. One analysis comparing current development to the regulated wetlands first mapped by New York State in the 1970s suggests 3–9 % of the wetland area has been filled in Staten Island alone (Eymund Deigel, personal communication, unpublished data). Incremental loss of salt marsh in NYC has also continued due to a variety of on-going environmental stressors and impacts. At seven wetland sites around the city, historic photo analysis from 1974 to 1999 and 2006 show loss rates of 1–2 % of the total salt marsh area per year (NYC Parks and Recreation Natural Resources Group 2010 unpublished data; Hartig et al. <cite><a href="#CR059">2002</a></cite>).

              </div></div><div class="Para">MillionTreesNYC (MTNYC), a campaign to plant one million trees in NYC by 2017, is one of the most visible and successful initiatives in PlaNYC. To achieve this ambitious goal, NYC Parks allocated US$400 million to the MTNYC campaign over 10 years and developed a public-private partnership with the local non-profit New York Restoration Project (NYRP). Ultimately, NYC plans to add 220,000 street trees, filling every available street tree opportunity, and plant 500,000 park trees. Meanwhile, NYRP is coordinating the planting of 300,000 trees with private organizations, homeowners, and community organizations. MTNYC has planted 612,277 trees as of 2012, over 97,870 of which are street trees.</div><div class="Para">At the beginning of the campaign, NYC Parks initiated a strategy of full-block planting to rapidly green entire neighborhoods, initially targeting areas with few trees and high asthma rates in a program called Trees for Public Health, that was devised based on NYC Department of Health data showing higher incidences of childhood respiratory ailments in these communities (MillionTreesNYC <cite><a href="#CR32">2012</a></cite>).</div><div class="Para">Public, private, and non-profit organizations have used the campaign to build community, encourage people-nature interactions and increase opportunities for civic ecology (Krasny and Tidball <cite><a href="#CR057">2012</a></cite>) and environmental education in an unprecedented citywide environmental movement. Significant effort has been made in research (McPhearson et al. <cite><a href="#CR28">2010a</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR29">b</a></cite>) and assessment (e.g., mortality studies and the relatively effectiveness of different tree pit designs) to make the MTNYC program as effective as possible.</div></div><div id="Sec23" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.5.7 </span>New York Metropolitan Flora Project</h3><div class="Para">In 1990, the Brooklyn Botanical Garden launched the New York Metropolitan Flora project (NYMF), a multi-year regional effort to document the flora in all counties within a 50-mile radius of New York City, including all of Long Island, southeastern New York State, northern New Jersey and Fairfield County, Connecticut.</div></div><div id="Sec24" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.5.8 </span>NYC Parks and Open Space Access</h3><div class="Para">One goal of PlaNYC is to ensure that every New Yorker lives within a 10-min walk of a park. Currently, more than two million residents are not within this range (PlaNYC <cite><a href="#CR56">2011</a></cite>). Since 2007, more than 250,000 New Yorkers have gained 10-min walk access to a park, nearly 180 schoolyards to playgrounds sites and 260 green streets have been developed (PlaNYC <cite><a href="#CR56">2011</a></cite>).</div><div class="Para">Additionally, since the first Waterfront Plan in 1992 NYC has acquired 506 ha of waterfront as parkland. Wastewater treatment initiatives, including US$6 billion allocation to upgrade the City’s wastewater treatment plants and more than US$1 billion to reduce CSOs, have contributed toward making the city’s waterways cleaner than they have been in a century. The 2010 Waterfront Open Space Plan calls for dozens of redevelopment sites to be completed by 2020 (NYC Comprehensive Waterfront Plan <cite><a href="#CR39">2011</a></cite>).</div></div><div id="Sec25" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.5.9 </span>Other Organizations Working in NYC</h3><div class="Para">NYC contains a rich network of organizations working in areas relates to biodiversity, stewardship, and civic engagement.

These efforts, which are particularly focused on waterfront, wetland and rare plant communities, involve cooperation among federal, state, local and nonprofit organizations.</div><div id="Sec27" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.6.1 </span>Green Infrastructure Plan</h3><div class="Para">NYC has adopted a sustainable infrastructure investment approach that addresses multiple goals by using “blue roofs,” larger street tree pits, “green streets,” porous concrete, and vacant lots to control stormwater and provide additional ecosystem services (Cohen and Ackerman <cite><a href="#CR056">2010</a></cite>; McPhearson et al. <cite><a href="#CR30">2012a</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR31">b</a></cite>). The plan (NYC Green Infrastructure Plan <cite><a href="#CR47">2010</a></cite>), which has committed a total of US$2.4 billion over 20 years, is designed to control 10 % of stormwater runoff using green infrastructure over 20 years and is estimated to reduce CSOs by approximately 1.5 billion gallons per year (Alamarie et al. <cite><a href="#CR1">2011</a></cite>). The Staten Island Bluebelt, one of the largest watershed-level stormwater management systems in the U.S. (4,856 ha of waterways and wetlands), is evidence of the importance of urban green infrastructure. The Bluebelt has proved to have 40 % removal efficiencies for nitrates and has saved the City more than US$80 million in comparison to traditional sewer construction (Gumb et al. <cite><a href="#CR14">2008</a></cite>).</div></div><div id="Sec28" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.6.2 </span>Waterfront Revitalization Program</h3><div class="Para">Since 2002, City, State and Federal partners have invested over US$56 million at 16 sites to restore 59 ha of wetland. Sixteen restoration projects involving 50 ha are expected to be completed by 2013 (NYC Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability <cite><a href="#CR49">2012</a></cite>). Additionally, the Waterfront Revitalization Program (WRP) designates Special Natural Waterfront Areas (SNWA), requiring that particular habitat features be considered in connection with development in these areas. Three SNWAs have recently been designed including Northwest Staten Island Harbor Herons Area, Jamaica Bay, and East River Long Island Sound. WRP calls for the City to prevent the net loss of wetlands. A 2012 revision of WRP to offer greater protection by designating additional sites of ecological importance is expected to be voted on by the City Planning Commission and City Council by late 2012 or early 2013, and would then be subjected to state and federal review before going into effect in 2013 or 2014.</div></div><div id="Sec29" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.6.3 </span>Special Natural Area District</h3><div class="Para">In 1975, the Special Natural Area District (SNAD) was created to improve preservation of natural features in parts of Staten Island, the Bronx and Queens. In order to guide development in a way that preserves unique natural features, the Planning Commission must review new developments and site alterations on primarily vacant land to ensure that significant natural features are preserved (NYC Department of City Planning <cite><a href="#CR40">2012</a></cite>).</div></div></div><div id="Sec30" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.7 </span>Recommendations for Biodiversity Management and Protection in NYC</h2><div id="Sec31" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.7.1 </span>Inventory and Assess Natural Areas in NYC</h3><div class="Para">Knowledge of the current distribution, abundance, and status of current biodiversity and natural areas is fundamental to any protection. The new Natural Areas Conservancy (see above) has urban biodiversity inventory as part of its mission for land held by the city. A preliminary wetlands assessment has been conducted as part of PlaNYC. It is hoped that other organizations, including large conservation NGOs, will also invest in such work. Planned efforts by the National Park Service around Jamaica Bay include long-term monitoring.</div></div><div id="Sec32" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.7.2 </span>Manage and Restore Natural Areas</h3><div class="Para">The NYC Department of Parks and Recreation is actively involved in restoration of forest habitats and intertidal zones. The National Park Service and others are engaged in restoration of wetland habitats, for example in Jamaica Bay. However, land conversion is still a significant threat in NYC, including in NYC parks, where there is persistent and legitimate demand for additional recreation facilities. All natural areas would benefit from comprehensive management plans that guide restoration work and inform managers of the consequences of land conversion for biodiversity and ecosystem services.</div></div><div id="Sec33" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.7.3 </span>More Research in the Potential for Green Infrastructure to Support Biodiversity</h3><div class="Para">Trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity and ecosystem services need to be better explored in urban planning, research and modeling to provide best practices for maximizing the biodiversity potential.</div></div><div id="Sec34" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.7.4 </span>Promote Native Species and Manage Against Invasive Species</h3><div class="Para">Requiring the use of native species and locally adapted varieties in all city planting and restoration efforts would benefit local ecosystems. MillionTreesNYC, for the most part, plants native species. Other programs are needed to promote the use of native species in green infrastructure programs such as Green Streets.

Remedying this fact is a core goal of PlaNYC. Additional analysis of the full suite of ecosystem services provided by green infrastructure combined with an increased understanding of the public need for a wide variety of ecosystem services provided at the neighborhood level would help to prioritize green space development in underserved areas of the city (McPhearson et al. <cite><a href="#CR30">2012a</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR31">b</a></cite>).</div></div><div id="Sec36" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">19.7.6 </span>Engage Citizens and Promote Ecological Literacy</h3><div class="Para">Connecting residents with urban nature is critical for developing nature awareness and students would benefit from increased opportunities in schools and communities to learn about nature in their backyards.

NYC has taken a significant step in this direction with PlaNYC, the environmental and economic sustainability plan for 2030. Major investments in green infrastructure, tree planting in target areas, ecological restoration, and habitat protection for biodiversity have helped make NYC a model global green city. Many organizations contribute to work now done in NYC, including federal and city agencies, non-profits, and community organizations working in research, planning, and stewardship. However, with nearly a million new residents expected within the city boundaries by 2030, and even more in the metropolitan region, there is still progress to be made in linking social planning with ecological planning across scales from neighborhoods to the region.</div><div class="Para">The Green Infrastructure Plan for NYC is one of the many strong examples of how NYC has focused on ecosystems as a resource for positive change within the city. The plan focuses primarily on stormwater absorption, but also represents a unique opportunity for NYC to substantially expand its already robust network of urban farms and gardens and transform vacant land into spaces that provide increased habitat for biodiversity, while developing corridors to improve connectivity among fragmented urban nature patches. The New York Metropolitan Region has historically harbored incredible biodiversity and, even with significant development, still retains strong ecological resources for ecosystem services. Open space protection in the region has proceeded aggressively in recent years especially driven by the Open Space Institute in collaboration with city and state governments, communities, farmers, and NGOs.</div><div class="Para">Ecosystems and the biodiversity in them provide critical ecosystem services to human inhabitants of NYC by supplying food, drinking water, wood and fiber, flood control, air purification, stormwater absorption, carbon sequestration and storage, temperature regulation, noise mitigation, aesthetic and recreational value, education opportunities, and a sense of well-being (for a complete review of NYC ecosystem services see CBO Scientific Assessment <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A308519_1_En_4_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">Chap.​ 4</span></a></span>, this volume). Therefore, the human components of the NYC social-ecological system are intimately tied to the ecological components of the city and the region. Trade-offs and synergies in the provisioning of ecosystem services need to be better explored in urban planning and scenario modeling to provide best practices for maximizing the biodiversity and ecosystem services in the NYC metropolitan region. The progress NYC has made in this regard in recent years is significant, with strong plans in place and powerful motivation among community groups and city agencies to continue building the necessary improvements to the socio-ecology of the New York regional system.</div></div><div class="Bibliography" id="Bib1"><div class="Heading">References</div><div class="BibliographyWrapper"><div class="Citation"><div class="CitationContent" id="CR1">Alamarie, K., Cohn, A., Larry dela Cruz, J., Donnelly, H., Eckels, M., Farag, M., Garcia, K., et al.
